# Liquid-Argon-Simulation
Simulation of Liquid Argon through Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo techniques
In this project we are interested in analyzing the results obtained simulating a Lennard-
Jones fluid through different tecniques: the first one will be a NVE simulation performed
through Molecular Dynamics; the second one a NVT simulation through Molecular dy-
namics and Nos√©-Hoover thermostat; the third one will be a Monte Carlo NVT simulation.
In order to compare the different approaches we will focus on some particular physical
quantities: the correlation function, the structure factor and finally the diffusion coeffi-
cient.
In the folder `libraries` you can find the implementation of the main MD and MC techniques used to obtain the results presented in the report.
